The ETL/ML project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight. 

The Project is subdivided into:
1. Preprocessing of data and ETL Pipeline (including data storage into a sql database)
2. Building trained model through machine Learning Pipeline and GridSearchCV to tune the model hyperparameters
3. Model deployment(Web app) with flask app.
